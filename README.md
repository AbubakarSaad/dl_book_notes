# Deep Learning Book Notes

These are my notes on the [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) book. There are many like them but these ones are mine.

They are all based on my second reading of the various chapters, and the hope is that they will help me solidify and review the material easily. If they can help someone out there too, that's great.

List of the notes:
